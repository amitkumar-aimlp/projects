## 2. Core Concepts

## 2.1 Neural Networks

Neural Networks are the backbone of Deep Learning, comprising interconnected neurons organized into layers.

### Overview of Neural Networks

Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of neurons where each neuron is connected to others in the subsequent layer. Data is passed through these layers, with each neuron applying a transformation to the data and passing the result to the next layer.

### Structure: Neurons, Layers, and Weights

- **Neurons**: The basic units of neural networks that receive input, apply a transformation (using an activation function), and send output to the next layer.
- **Layers**: Neural networks are composed of:
  - **Input Layer**: Receives the raw input data.
  - **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers where computations are performed. These layers extract features from the data.
  - **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction or classification result.
- **Weights**: Parameters that are adjusted during training to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs. Each connection between neurons has an associated weight that influences the data flow through the network.

### Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to model complex patterns:

- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Computes the positive part of its input (max(0, x)). It is efficient and helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.
- **Sigmoid**: Maps outputs to a range between 0 and 1. It is often used in binary classification tasks but can suffer from vanishing gradients.
- **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**: Maps outputs to a range between -1 and 1. It is centered around zero, which can make optimization easier compared to the sigmoid function.

## 2.2 Architecture of Deep Neural Networks

### Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)

Feedforward Neural Networks are the simplest type of neural network where connections between nodes do not form cycles. Data flows from the input layer to the output layer through hidden layers, with each layer performing a transformation on the data.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

CNNs are specialized neural networks designed for processing grid-like data such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features. Key components include:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Apply filters to input data to produce feature maps.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the dimensionality of feature maps while retaining important features (e.g., max pooling).
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Connect every neuron from the previous layer to every neuron in the current layer, used to combine features learned by convolutional layers.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

- **RNN**: Designed for sequential data where the output depends on previous computations. Useful for tasks such as time-series forecasting and language modeling.
- **LSTM**: A type of RNN that can capture long-term dependencies and avoid vanishing gradients. It uses gates to control the flow of information, making it effective for tasks with long sequences, such as text generation and speech recognition.

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GANs consist of two networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator evaluates its authenticity. The two networks are trained simultaneously, with the generator improving its ability to produce realistic data and the discriminator becoming better at distinguishing real from fake data.

### Transformer Networks

Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process sequences of data more effectively than RNNs. They have revolutionized NLP tasks by enabling models to consider the relationships between all words in a sentence, leading to significant improvements in machine translation, text generation, and question answering.

### Attention Mechanisms

Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on different parts of the input data when making predictions. For example, in machine translation, attention helps the model focus on relevant words in the source language when generating words in the target language.

## 2.3 Training Deep Learning Models

### Forward Propagation

Forward Propagation involves passing input data through the network layers to obtain an output. Each layer performs computations and transformations on the data, culminating in the final prediction or classification.

### Backpropagation and Gradient Descent

  - **Batch Gradient Descent**: Uses the entire training dataset to compute gradients.
  - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Uses individual training examples, which introduces noise but can lead to faster convergence.
  - **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: Combines the benefits of both by using small batches of data for gradient computation.

### Loss Functions

- **Cross-Entropy**: Measures the difference between the true class probabilities and the predicted probabilities. Commonly used in classification tasks.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. Used in regression tasks to evaluate model performance.

### Optimization Algorithms

- **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**: Updates weights based on each training example, introducing noise but allowing for faster convergence.
- **Adam**: An adaptive learning rate algorithm that combines the advantages of momentum and adaptive gradient methods. It adjusts learning rates based on the first and second moments of gradients.
- **RMSprop**: Normalizes the learning rate based on a moving average of squared gradients, which helps stabilize training.

### Learning Rate Schedulers

Learning rate schedulers adjust the learning rate during training to improve convergence. Common techniques include:

- **Step Decay**: Reduces the learning rate by a factor at predefined epochs.
- **Exponential Decay**: Decreases the learning rate exponentially over time.
- **Cosine Annealing**: Modulates the learning rate following a cosine function, which helps escape local minima and improve training.

### Batch Normalization

Batch Normalization normalizes the inputs to a layer by adjusting and scaling activations. It reduces internal covariate shift, leading to faster training and improved model performance.

## 2.4 Evaluation Metrics

### Classification Metrics

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions. Useful for balanced datasets.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positives among all predicted positives. Important for tasks where false positives are costly.
- **Recall**: The proportion of true positives among all actual positives. Crucial for tasks where false negatives are costly.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.

### Regression Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. Provides a straightforward measure of prediction accuracy.
- **R^2 Score**: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable. An R^2 score close to 1 indicates a good fit.

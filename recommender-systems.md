## 1. Introduction to Recommender Systems

![Recommender Systems Algorithms](assets/recommender-systems/recommender-systems-algorithms.png)

Recommender systems are algorithms designed to suggest items to users based on various data inputs. They are widely used in online platforms such as e-commerce sites, streaming services, and social networks to enhance user experience by providing personalized content. These systems analyze user behavior, preferences, and interactions to deliver relevant recommendations, which can significantly improve user satisfaction and engagement.
The primary goal of recommender systems is to help users find items that they will like, which in turn helps platforms increase user retention and sales. The effectiveness of these systems is often measured by how accurately they can predict user preferences and how well they can introduce users to new items that they might not have discovered on their own.

## 2. Types of Recommender Systems

![Types of Recommender Systems](assets/recommender-systems/types-of-recommender-systems.png)

### 2.1 Content-Based Filtering

**Definition:** Content-based filtering recommends items similar to those a user has liked in the past. This method relies on the features of the items and the userâ€™s preferences, creating a profile for each user and item.

**Features:**

- **Uses Item Features and User Profiles:** Analyzes the characteristics of items (e.g., genre, author, description) and user preferences to make recommendations. For example, if a user likes science fiction books, the system will recommend other books in the same genre.
- **Employs Algorithms like TF-IDF and Word2Vec:** Uses text-based analysis techniques to understand item features and similarities. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) helps in finding important words in item descriptions, while Word2Vec creates word embeddings to understand the context and relationships between words.
- **Easy to Understand and Implement:** Straightforward approach that is easy to explain and implement. Users can easily understand why certain items are being recommended based on their past preferences.

**Advantages:**

- **Does Not Require User Data:** Can provide recommendations based solely on item features, making it useful for new users (solving the cold start problem for items). This is particularly beneficial for platforms with many new users or infrequent visitors.
- **Good for New Items:** Effective for recommending newly added items that do not have interaction data yet. This ensures that new products, articles, or media get exposure even without historical user interaction.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Limited by Quality and Quantity of Item Features:** The effectiveness depends on the availability and quality of item features. Poorly described items or items with limited metadata may not be recommended accurately.
- **Can Lead to a Narrow Range of Recommendations:** May result in recommendations that are too similar, lacking diversity. Users might get bored with recommendations that don't introduce enough variety or new categories.

### 2.2 Collaborative Filtering

![Collaborative Filtering Animation](assets/recommender-systems/collaborative-filtering.gif)

**Definition:** Collaborative filtering recommends items based on the preferences of similar users. This method uses user-item interaction data to find patterns and make recommendations.

**Features:**

- **User-Based and Item-Based Approaches:** User-based collaborative filtering finds similar users, while item-based collaborative filtering finds similar items. User-based methods identify users with similar tastes and recommend items that those users have liked. Item-based methods find items that are similar to items the user has liked before.
- **Utilizes User-Item Interaction Data:** Analyzes user behavior, such as ratings, clicks, and purchases. This data is used to create a matrix of users and items, where each entry represents the interaction between a user and an item.
- **Algorithms Include k-NN and Matrix Factorization (SVD):** Employs various algorithms to identify patterns in user-item interactions. k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) is used to find similar users or items, while matrix factorization techniques like SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) decompose the interaction matrix to discover latent factors.

**Advantages:**

- **Can Recommend Diverse Items:** Capable of suggesting items from different categories based on user behavior. This diversity can help users discover new interests and keep their experience fresh.
- **Does Not Require Item Features:** Works purely on interaction data, making it versatile. This is useful for platforms where item metadata is sparse or inconsistent.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Suffers from Cold Start Problem for New Users:** Requires sufficient interaction data to provide accurate recommendations. New users who have not interacted much with the platform may not receive accurate recommendations initially.
- **Scalability Issues with Large Datasets:** Can become computationally expensive with large user and item datasets. Efficient algorithms and infrastructure are needed to handle the scale of large platforms.

### 2.3 Hybrid Methods

**Definition:** Hybrid methods combine multiple recommendation techniques to improve accuracy and robustness. These methods leverage the strengths of different approaches to provide better recommendations.

**Features:**

- **Can Integrate Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering:** Combines various techniques to enhance recommendation quality. For example, Netflix uses a hybrid approach to combine user ratings (collaborative filtering) with movie metadata (content-based filtering) to recommend movies.
- **Uses Methods like Weighted Hybrid and Switching Hybrid:** Employs different strategies to merge recommendations from multiple methods. Weighted hybrid assigns different weights to the recommendations from different methods, while switching hybrid uses different methods based on the context or user type.

**Advantages:**

- **Overcomes Limitations of Individual Methods:** Addresses the weaknesses of content-based and collaborative filtering. For instance, hybrid methods can handle both new users and new items effectively.
- **Provides More Accurate and Diverse Recommendations:** Leverages multiple data sources and algorithms for better results. This results in a more comprehensive understanding of user preferences and item characteristics.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Increased Complexity in Implementation:** More challenging to design and implement. It requires integrating multiple algorithms and ensuring they work together seamlessly.
- **Requires More Computational Resources:** Demands higher computational power and data processing capabilities. The combination of different methods can increase the computational load.

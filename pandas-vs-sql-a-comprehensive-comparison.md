## Introduction

![pandas-vs-sql](/assets/pandas/pandas-vs-sql.png)
In the realm of data manipulation and analysis, Pandas and SQL stand as stalwarts in their respective domains. Pandas, a Python library, offers powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis, while SQL (Structured Query Language) serves as the standard language for managing relational databases. This article delves into a detailed comparison of Pandas and SQL, exploring their features, strengths, and ideal use cases.

## Data Structures

### Pandas<!-- omit in toc -->

Pandas revolves around three primary data structures:

- **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.
- **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types, akin to a table in a relational database.
- **Panel**: Deprecated since version 0.25.0, previously a three-dimensional data structure.

### SQL<!-- omit in toc -->

SQL operates around tables, views, and indexes:

- **Tables**: Fundamental structures that store data in rows and columns.
- **Views**: Virtual tables derived from the result of a SQL query, providing a dynamic way to look at data.

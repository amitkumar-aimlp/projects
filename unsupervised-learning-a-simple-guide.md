## Introduction

![Unsupervised Learning - A Simple Guide](assets/unsupervised-learning/unsupervised-learning.jpg)

Unsupervised learning is a cornerstone of machine learning that deals with data without labeled responses. Unlike supervised learning, where algorithms are trained on a predefined output, unsupervised learning seeks to understand the underlying structure of the data, identify patterns, and extract meaningful information. This guide will delve into the various aspects of unsupervised learning, including its key concepts, types, popular algorithms, applications, and the tools used to implement these methods.

## Key Concepts

### What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using data that does not have labeled responses. The primary goal is to infer the natural structure present within a set of data points. It is used to draw inferences and patterns from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Exploratory Nature**: The exploratory nature of unsupervised learning makes it ideal for understanding the structure of complex data.
- **Data-Driven**: It relies heavily on the data itself to find patterns and relationships, making it versatile across different types of datasets.
- **No Need for Labels**: The absence of labeled data means that it can be applied to vast amounts of data where manual labeling is impractical or impossible.

### Types of Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning encompasses several techniques, each serving a different purpose:

- **Clustering**: This technique involves grouping data points into clusters based on their similarities. It helps in identifying natural groupings within the data.
  - Examples: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: This technique reduces the number of random variables under consideration, helping in simplifying models and visualizing high-dimensional data.
  - Examples: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- **Association**: This technique finds interesting relations between variables in large databases, often used in market basket analysis.
  - Examples: Apriori Algorithm, Eclat Algorithm

## Clustering

### K-Means Clustering

#### Overview

K-Means Clustering is a popular method of vector quantization originally from signal processing, which aims to partition n observations into k clusters. Each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.

#### Steps

1. **Initialize k centroids randomly**: Start with k random points as centroids.
2. **Assign each data point to the nearest centroid**: Calculate the distance of each data point to all centroids and assign it to the nearest one.
3. **Recalculate the centroids**: Compute the new centroid of each cluster by taking the mean of all data points assigned to it.
4. **Repeat the assignment and update steps until convergence**: Continue the process until the centroids no longer change significantly.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages**: Simple to implement, efficient for large datasets, and works well with compact and well-separated clusters.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires specifying the number of clusters in advance, sensitive to initial centroid placement, and not suitable for clusters with non-convex shapes or varying densities.

### Hierarchical Clustering

#### Overview

Hierarchical Clustering is a method of cluster analysis that seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. It creates a tree-like structure called a dendrogram that represents the nested grouping of data points and the order in which clusters are merged or split.

#### Types

- **Agglomerative**: This is a bottom-up approach where each data point starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.
- **Divisive**: This is a top-down approach where all data points start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages**: Does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance, produces a hierarchy of clusters, and can capture nested clusters.
- **Disadvantages**: Computationally intensive for large datasets, sensitive to noise and outliers, and difficult to interpret dendrograms for large datasets.

### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

#### Overview

DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that identifies areas of high density and separates them from areas of low density. Unlike K-Means, it does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance and can find arbitrarily shaped clusters.

#### Advantages

- **Arbitrary shape**: Can find clusters of arbitrary shape.
- **Noise handling**: Can handle noise and outliers effectively.
- **No need for a predefined number of clusters**: Automatically determines the number of clusters based on the data.

#### Disadvantages

- **Parameter sensitivity**: Requires careful tuning of parameters like epsilon (maximum distance between points in a cluster) and MinPts (minimum number of points in a cluster).
- **Not suitable for datasets with varying densities**: Struggles with datasets containing clusters with different densities.

## Dimensionality Reduction

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

#### Overview

PCA is a statistical procedure that uses orthogonal transformation to convert possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. It is widely used for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving as much variability as possible.

#### Steps

1. **Standardize the data**: Ensure each variable contributes equally to the analysis.
2. **Compute the covariance matrix**: Measure the extent to which variables change together.
3. **Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors**: Identify the directions (principal components) along which the data varies the most.
4. **Form a feature vector**: Select the top k eigenvectors to form a new feature space.
5. **Derive the new dataset**: Transform the original dataset into the new feature space.

#### Applications

- **Data Visualization**: Simplifies high-dimensional data for visualization.
- **Noise Reduction**: Eliminates noise by focusing on the most significant components.
- **Feature Extraction**: Helps in extracting important features from the data.

### t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

#### Overview

t-SNE is a machine learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. It reduces the dimensions of the data while preserving the relationships between data points as much as possible.

#### Advantages

- **Local structure**: Captures much of the local structure of the data.
- **Visualization**: Excellent for visualizing complex datasets.
- **Non-linear dimensionality reduction**: Handles non-linear relationships between variables effectively.

#### Disadvantages

- **Computationally intensive**: Requires significant computational resources for large datasets.
- **Parameter sensitivity**: Sensitive to parameter choices, such as perplexity and learning rate.

## Association

### Apriori Algorithm

#### Overview

#### Steps

1. **Identify frequent individual items**: Determine items that appear frequently in the dataset.
2. **Generate larger item sets**: Extend frequent items to larger item sets, checking their frequency.
3. **Extract association rules**: Identify the association rules that meet the minimum support and confidence criteria.

#### Applications

- **Market Basket Analysis**: Identifies product combinations that are frequently purchased together.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggests products to users based on frequently purchased combinations.
- **Inventory Management**: Helps in stocking related products together.

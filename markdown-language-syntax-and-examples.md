## How GitHub Pages Converts Markdown to HTML

![markdown-flowchart](/assets/markdown/markdown-flowchart.png)

GitHub Pages is a powerful feature provided by GitHub that allows users to host static websites directly from their GitHub repositories. One of the key aspects of this feature is its ability to convert Markdown files into HTML, making it easy for users to create and maintain websites with minimal effort.

When you create a Markdown file in your GitHub repository, GitHub Pages uses a static site generator called Jekyll to convert the Markdown content into HTML. Jekyll is an open-source tool designed specifically for transforming plain text into static websites and blogs. It supports Markdown out of the box, making it an excellent choice for GitHub Pages.

The process begins when you push your Markdown files to a repository configured for GitHub Pages. Jekyll takes over and processes these files according to the settings defined in a `_config.yml` file or by using default settings if none are specified. During this process, Jekyll parses the Markdown syntax and applies any layouts or templates you've defined to create the final HTML files.

Markdown syntax is highly readable and easy to write, with features for headers, lists, links, images, and more. Jekyll converts these elements into their corresponding HTML tags. For instance, a Markdown header defined with `#` will be converted to an HTML `<h1>` tag, and a link written as `[Link Text](URL)` will become an HTML `<a>` tag. This conversion ensures that your content is properly formatted and styled according to web standards.

Additionally, Jekyll supports Liquid templating, allowing you to include dynamic content and logic in your Markdown files. You can use Liquid tags and filters to insert variables, control flow, and iterate over collections, adding a layer of customization and functionality to your static site.

In summary, GitHub Pages simplifies the process of creating static websites by automatically converting Markdown files into HTML using Jekyll. This allows users to focus on writing content in an easy-to-read format while leveraging the power of a static site generator to produce professional-looking web pages.

## Markdown Language: Syntax and Examples

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax designed to make writing on the web easier. It allows writers to format text using simple, intuitive symbols and characters rather than complex HTML tags. For example, headers are created using the `#` symbol, with the number of `#` signs indicating the level of the header (`#` for H1, `##` for H2, and so on). Emphasis can be added to text using asterisks or underscores (`*italic*` or `_italic_` for italics, `**bold**` or `__bold__` for bold). Lists are also straightforward: unordered lists use dashes, plus signs, or asterisks (`-`, `+`, or `*`), while ordered lists use numbers followed by periods (`1.`).

Examples of Markdown syntax extend to various other common formatting needs. Links and images are embedded with a clear and simple syntax: `[Link Text](URL)` for links and `![Alt Text](Image URL)` for images. Blockquotes are created using the `>` character, making it easy to format quotations. Code blocks can be included by wrapping text in backticks (`code`) for inline code or triple backticks (`code block`) for blocks of code. Tables, which are more complex in HTML, can be created with relative ease using pipes (`|`) and dashes to define columns and rows. This simplicity and readability make Markdown a popular choice for documentation, readme files, and writing on platforms like GitHub and Reddit.

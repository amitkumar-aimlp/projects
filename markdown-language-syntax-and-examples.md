## Markdown Language: Syntax and Examples

![markdown-flowchart](/assets/markdown/markdown-flowchart.avif)

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax designed to make writing on the web easier. It allows writers to format text using simple, intuitive symbols and characters rather than complex HTML tags. For example, headers are created using the `#` symbol, with the number of `#` signs indicating the level of the header (`#` for H1, `##` for H2, and so on). Emphasis can be added to text using asterisks or underscores (`*italic*` or `_italic_` for italics, `**bold**` or `__bold__` for bold). Lists are also straightforward: unordered lists use dashes, plus signs, or asterisks (`-`, `+`, or `*`), while ordered lists use numbers followed by periods (`1.`).

Examples of Markdown syntax extend to various other common formatting needs. Links and images are embedded with a clear and simple syntax: `[Link Text](URL)` for links and `![Alt Text](Image URL)` for images. Blockquotes are created using the `>` character, making it easy to format quotations. Code blocks can be included by wrapping text in backticks (`code`) for inline code or triple backticks (`code block`) for blocks of code. Tables, which are more complex in HTML, can be created with relative ease using pipes (`|`) and dashes to define columns and rows. This simplicity and readability make Markdown a popular choice for documentation, readme files, and writing on platforms like GitHub and Reddit.

## 1. Introduction to Semi-supervised Learning

![Semi-supervised Learning](assets/semi-supervised-learning/semi-supervised-learning.png)

### 1.1. Definition

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a hybrid machine learning technique that incorporates both labeled and unlabeled data to enhance model performance. In contrast to supervised learning, which relies solely on labeled data, SSL leverages the large quantities of unlabeled data that are often readily available. The goal is to make better use of the limited labeled data while improving model accuracy and generalization by utilizing the additional information from unlabeled data.

### 1.2. Importance

SSL is crucial in scenarios where labeled data is limited due to high annotation costs or the difficulty of obtaining accurate labels. By leveraging unlabeled data, SSL methods can:

- **Enhance Model Accuracy**: Improve prediction performance through additional learning from unlabeled examples.
- **Reduce Annotation Costs**: Decrease the financial and time investments required for data labeling.
- **Address Data Scarcity**: Provide solutions when labeled data is insufficient for traditional supervised learning approaches.

## 2. Types of Semi-supervised Learning

### 2.1. Self-training

Self-training is an iterative approach where a model initially trained on labeled data is used to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. These pseudo-labels are then added to the training set, and the model is retrained on this augmented dataset.

- **Process**:
  1. Train the initial model on labeled data.
  2. Predict labels for unlabeled data.
  3. Incorporate high-confidence predictions as pseudo-labels.
  4. Retrain the model with both labeled and pseudo-labeled data.
- **Pros**: Straightforward and often effective when initial model performance is reasonably good.
- **Cons**: If the model makes incorrect predictions, errors can be propagated and amplified in subsequent iterations.

### 2.2. Co-training

Co-training involves training two or more classifiers on different, but complementary, feature sets of the same data. Each classifier labels the unlabeled data, and these labels are used to retrain the other classifiers.

- **Process**:
  1. Train multiple classifiers on different feature views.
  2. Each classifier labels the unlabeled data based on its feature view.
  3. Exchange labels between classifiers to update training data.
- **Pros**: Reduces the risk of error propagation by using diverse feature perspectives.
- **Cons**: Requires that feature sets are independent and informative; otherwise, the approach might be less effective.

### 2.3. Multi-view Learning

Multi-view learning extends the idea of co-training by incorporating multiple distinct views or representations of the data. Each view is expected to provide complementary information, leading to more robust learning.

- **Process**:
  1. Represent data in multiple views or feature spaces.
  2. Train models on each view separately or jointly.
  3. Combine predictions from all views to improve performance.
- **Pros**: Leverages a richer set of features and improves learning from diverse data perspectives.
- **Cons**: Complexity in model training and integration of different views; may require sophisticated algorithms.

### 2.4. Graph-based Methods

Graph-based methods model data as a graph where nodes represent data points and edges represent similarities or relationships between them. Label propagation through the graph is used to infer labels for unlabeled nodes based on the labels of connected nodes.

- **Process**:
  1. Construct a graph based on data similarities.
  2. Propagate labels through the graph using algorithms like label propagation or graph convolution.
  3. Assign labels to unlabeled nodes based on their connections.
- **Pros**: Effectively captures data structure and relational information.
- **Cons**: Computationally demanding and may require sophisticated graph processing techniques.

### 2.5. Consistency Regularization

Consistency regularization enforces the model to produce consistent predictions for perturbed versions of the same input. This approach helps in improving model robustness and generalization by regularizing the decision boundaries.

- **Techniques**:
  - **Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT)**: Adds adversarial perturbations to inputs and encourages the model to maintain stable predictions.
  - **Temporal Ensembling**: Combines predictions from multiple epochs or models to smooth out predictions.
- **Pros**: Enhances model stability and robustness to input variations.
- **Cons**: May increase training time and computational requirements.

## 3. Techniques and Algorithms

### 3.1. Pseudo-labelling

Pseudo-labelling involves using the modelâ€™s own predictions as labels for unlabeled data. This technique extends the training dataset with these pseudo-labels to improve model performance.

- **Process**:
  1. Train on labeled data to obtain initial model.
  2. Predict labels for unlabeled data.
  3. Select high-confidence predictions as pseudo-labels.
  4. Retrain the model with both original labeled data and pseudo-labeled data.
- **Applications**: Often used in scenarios where labeled data is scarce and unlabeled data is abundant.

### 3.2. Generative Models

Generative models learn the underlying distribution of data and can be used to generate synthetic examples or improve representations of unlabeled data. They help in modeling complex data distributions and enhancing learning.

- **Examples**:
  - **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Learn latent representations of the data and can generate new samples.
  - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Utilize adversarial training to generate realistic data samples.
- **Pros**: Can create high-quality synthetic data and improve model robustness.
- **Cons**: Requires careful tuning and may be computationally intensive.

### 3.3. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)

GCNs extend convolutional networks to operate on graph-structured data. They aggregate information from neighboring nodes to update node representations and make predictions.

- **Applications**: Useful for tasks involving relational data like social networks, molecular graphs, and citation networks.
- **Pros**: Captures complex relationships and structures within data.
- **Cons**: Requires efficient graph processing capabilities and may have scalability issues.

### 3.4. Label Propagation

Label propagation spreads labels through a graph based on node similarities. It iteratively updates labels of unlabeled nodes based on the labels of their neighbors until convergence.

- **Process**:
  1. Initialize labels on a subset of nodes.
  2. Propagate labels to neighboring nodes.
  3. Update labels iteratively until they stabilize.
- **Pros**: Simple and effective for many graph-based tasks.
- **Cons**: May be sensitive to graph construction and initialization.

### 3.5. Dual Learning

Dual learning involves training two models in tandem, where one model focuses on labeled data and the other utilizes unlabeled data. The two models exchange information to improve each otherâ€™s performance.

- **Pros**: Balances the learning from both labeled and unlabeled data, potentially improving overall model performance.
- **Cons**: Requires synchronization between models and may be complex to implement.

### 3.6. Teacher-Student Framework

In this framework, a more complex, well-trained teacher model guides a simpler student model. The student learns from both labeled data and the teacherâ€™s predictions on unlabeled data.

- **Pros**: Facilitates knowledge transfer from a more complex model to a simpler one, enhancing the student model's performance.
- **Cons**: Requires careful management of the teacher-student relationship and alignment.
